## Course Description

### Catalog Description

An introduction to small-scale, purpose-built physical computational objects which embed sensors, integrate with networks, and process environmental signals. Exploring various industrial architectures, students develop devices that respond to physical stimuli and transmit data across networks to motivate additional device behavior and interactivity while considering human interaction design (HID) and "people-centered" principles that drive device design. During weekly laboratory sessions, students complete projects which focus on industry standards of data transmission and privacy in addition to optimizing device performance for real-time, high-availability applications. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions. Prerequisite: CMPSC 200.

Distribution Requirements: SB (Social Behavior and Institutions), SP (Scientific Process).

### Course Learning Outcomes

Students who earn a C or better in this course will achieve the following objectives:

1. Identify components of the Internet of Things (IoT) architecture and select the most appropriate IoT devices and sensors for an IoT application. (SP)
2. Set up the electronic circuitry needed for IoT devices, and then collect and analyze data from IoT devices. (SP)
3. Design, implement, test, and deploy an IoT system that is connected to cloud computing infrastructure while keeping human interaction in mind. (SP, SB)
4. Select an appropriate protocol for communication between IoT devices and secure the elements of the IoT device while considering issues of privacy. (SP, SB)
5. Use effective oral and written communication methods to explain the technical details of an IoT artifact. (SP)

## Required materials

### Laptop

A department-approved laptop, with an adequate charge, is required in every class session.

The laptop requirements are avaialable [here](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/resources/laptops/#:~:text=Department%20Approved%20Laptops&text=In%20order%20to%20successfully%20complete,10%20or%2011%2064%2Dbit). If you don't have a laptop that meets these specifications, you can request to borrow one using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSds-N61LLpYpZZBunlR_JigGH9eOBxvZfpEV71o73DyhTDQvw/viewform). The department has a limited number of loaner laptops available, so the earlier you request, the better!

### Textbook(s)

There are no textbooks for this course. Any texts or articles used will be available online or distributed in class.

### Platforms

This course relies on the GitHub and Discord. You will also need to use a [MicroPython enabled IDE](https://docs.arduino.cc/micropython/basics/code-editors). Your work will be assigned and evaluated using these platforms and official course communication will take place through them. You are expected to sign up for accounts and remain active on these platforms throughout the semester.

### Class Supplies

This course deals with physical circuitry and computing, and assignments require microcontrollers and electronic components. The department will provide the necesary supplies for you to complete assignments during the semester, but you are expected to care for these items and possibly return them at the end of the course.

We use rechargeable batteries in this course so take care not to lose them!

Every student will be provided with an Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect to use for the semester. This device supports MicroPython and CircuitPython. We will have additional boards using MicroPython as needed for projects.

This class will primarily use Python programming with the libraries above. There may also be occassion for programming in Java.

## Assignments & Evaluation

This course will include several introductory mini-projects in the first several weeks, followed by three larger projects: an art project, a environmental science project, and a final project of your choice. These projects will be largely self or team-directed. This format emphasizes independent research and reading documentation to find solutions. This type of initiative and problems-solving is critical to excellence in engineering.

In addition to completing project objectives, each student will write and present two short research essays. 

Your letter grade will be based on a score out of twenty with the following criteria. For each project assignment, you will be able to set your own goals within the pre-definied categories. More info will be provided in assignment details

#### Evaluation Criteria and Points

##### IoT Concepts: Up to Four Points Each, Max 16 Points Total

You can receive up to four points in each of the listed IoT categories. The maximum score you will receive in all five categories is 14 if any one category has fewer than two checks. The maximum score you can receive in all five IoT categories is 16, regardless of your total.

1. Sensing (CLO 1)
2. Circuity and Design (CLO 2)
3. Data Analysis and Visualization (CLO 2)
4. Circuitry & Interaction Design (CLO 2)
5. Interdevice Communicaiton (CLO 4)

You can receive up one point per category for each large project. In order ot receive a point, you will define and achieve a project-goal related to that category, according to the terms of the assignment. Written reflection will be an important part of goal achievement (CLO 5). You will also have opportunities to receive points in these categories in the mini-projects at the start of the term. 

##### Attendance: One Point

In order to receive a point for attendance, attend 80% of class sessions. If you are late to a session or if you leave early, that will count as a partial session.

##### Participation: One Point

Participate in class regularly: participation can include sharing work, talking during class discussions, asking/answering professor questions, attending office hours, collaborating with fellow students

##### Short Essay Assignments: One point each

Each student will write and present two short research essays about the Internet of Things: one a cautionary tale, the other an inspirational story (CLO 5). You will receive a point for each essay where you fulfill all requirements stipulated in the assignment.

There will be opportunities to present each Tuesday. It's a good idea to get this out of the way early in the semester. You can sign up for the week of your choice to present. If the volunteer system doesn't end up working, the professor will begin assigning presentation times.


#### Letter Grade Scale

The following points received out of twenty correspond to the following letter grades:

| Score | Grade        |
| ----- | ------------ |
| 20    | **A**  |
| 19    | **A-** |
| 18    | **B+** |

| <=10  | **F**  |

## Course Policies

### Illness and Wellness, Mental and Physical

**If you think you may be sick, stay home** —- particularly if your symptoms suggest a contagious illness (i.e. cough, fever, sneezing, sore throat). You will ultimately lose more time if you don't allow your body the rest it needs to heal. The class as a whole will succeed better if we make the effort to protect one another from illness. If you experience respiratory symptoms and do not feel you can miss class, please wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth. I will also entertain requests to record portions of class, but make no guarantees.

As a college student, there may be times when personal stressors, struggles, and/or traumas interfere with your academic performance and/or negatively impact your daily life. Allegheny College recognizes that mental health is an important piece of the holistic human experience, and that this experience influences your academic success. We encourage students to prioritize their mental well-being by seeking services and support as needed.

This class is designed with a relatively lenient attendance and deadline policy, in order to accommodate the obstacles that happen in real life (see evaluation section for more details). If you are sick, experiencing an emergency, or you are struggling emotionally, communicate with me about it as early as you can, and we will strategize accordingly. As long as you attend class and do coursework when you are feeling well, there is some space built in for harder times. If you feel overwhelmed even within these structures, you can let me know that too.

If you are dealing with something contagious, or something that requires particular accommodations, feel free to let me know. Otherwise, I don't require details. You can simply let me know that you are struggling and I will believe you. Processing certain details may lie beyond my professional expertise, and I want to do my best to serve you in my capacity as your professor.

Students who are in need of mental health support can access free, confidential services and resources in the Counseling and Personal Development Center (CPDC). CPDC delivers holistic mental health services to the Allegheny College student campus community through brief individual and group counseling, crisis support, outreach programming, consultation, and coordination of care. Students may request services by submitting a form on CPDC’s website (sites.allegheny.edu/counseling). Students may also connect with a mental health clinician at any time by calling Allegheny’s 24/7 line: 814-332-2105. If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health emergency, please call the 24/7 line, Public Safety (814-332-3357), or 911. When in doubt, reach out.

### Assistance with course concepts

Students who struggle to understand knowledge and skills defined in this course are encouraged to seek assistance from the course instructor. Students who need the course instructor’s assistance can schedule an appointment through their Office Hour Calendar near the top of this page.

### Academic Alerts

Allegheny College uses an Academic Alert system to send progress notices to the class deans in the Maytum Center for Student Success (MCSS). The progress notices are not punitive. They are an opportunity to connect you with your class dean who can offer additional support and suggest resources if you need assistance. These notices may encourage faculty advisors, coaches (for student-athletes), or other support staff to provide outreach to you as well.

### Classroom ethics

The discipline of computer science, like many others, encourages its members to act according to discipline-specific ethics. I encourage you to take time to review the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) [Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf).

### Allegheny College Statement of Community

Allegheny College also expects students and faculty to act according to its Statement of Community:

> Allegheny students and employees are committed to creating an inclusive, respectful and safe residential learning community that will actively confront and challenge racism, sexism, heterosexism, religious bigotry, and other forms of harassment and discrimination. We encourage individual growth by promoting a free exchange of ideas in a setting that values diversity, trust and equality. So that the right of all to participate in a shared learning experience is upheld, Allegheny affirms its commitment to the principles of freedom of speech and inquiry, while at the same time fostering responsibility and accountability in the exercise of these freedoms. This statement does not replace existing personnel policies and codes of conduct.

Keep both of these standards in mind as you exercise your academic inquiry in this course. These serve as our fundamental "first principles" in pursuit of our shared academic goals.

### Honor Code

All students and faculty at Allegheny College are bound by the Honor Code. Everyone expects that your behavior reflects this commitment. Given the eminently shareable and reproducible nature of code, the Department of Computer Science adds the following statement to the general college policy:

> It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with teachers, student assistants, and fellow students. Such dialogue is encouraged. However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others, and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else’s work. It will therefore be understood that all assignments submitted to faculty of the Department of Computer Science are to be the original work of the student submitting the assignment, and should be signed in accordance with the provisions of the Honor Code. Appropriate action will be taken when assignments give evidence that they were derived from the work of others.

As the nature of "plagiarism" and constituents of "fair use" change often, the department encourages you to periodically review the specific tenets of the general college Honor Code provided in the latest course catalog and in the *Compass* .

The above statement, of course, also applies to online forums such as Stack Overflow, et al.

### Borrowed Code + Copilot in this class

As an elaboration of the honor code cited above, in this class we have specific policies about borrowed code, as well as AI-assisted code (Copilot).

If you borrow any section of code more than two lines long (even if you modify it), you must link to the code source in the comments and specify where the borrowed code begins and ends. This includes code found online, code from your friends, and even code from class demos. In addition, note the lines you have modified in the code. In certain cases, you may be asked to document what each piece of code does, regardless of whether you borrowed it.

If you use Copilot, you must identify the prompt in your code comments and also delineate the code that came from Copilot and if/how you modified it.

Borrowing code correctly is a big part of being a professional computer scientist, and so it won’t be penalized as long as the code is cited as above and doesn’t constitute more than 50% of your project.

Work that violates the above policy will be dealt with as plagiarism.

### Religious Observance

If you need to miss class or reschedule a final examination due to a religious observance, please speak to the professor well in advance to make arrangements. Please see [https://sites.allegheny.edu/religiouslife/religious-holy-days/](https://sites.allegheny.edu/religiouslife/religious-holy-days/) for more details.

### Educational Accommodations

Students with disabilities who believe they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact Student Accessibility and Support Services (SASS) at (814) 332-2898. Student Accessibility and Support Services is located in Pelletier Library. Please do this as soon as possible to ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion. Please see [https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentaccessibility/](https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentaccessibility/) for more details.
